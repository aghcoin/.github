# AGH Code Industry Library

AGH Code Industry Library is a set of ready to use components for building games in Unity.

Each repository contains a separate functionality, which can be used independently.

Documentation and examples for all libraries can be found [here](https://aghcoin.github.io/articles/get_started/introduction.html).

## Installation

**Installation link must end with .git**: `https://github.com/aghcoin/coinpkg.playfabservices.git`

To install the library, copy link to repository containing desired component, open Unity Package Manager, click on `+` button and select `Add package from git URL...` option.

Some packages may need dependencies that are not included in the package or package manifest. In this case, you will need to install them manually.
